I got help from my tutor about what hidden cases might exist. 

It is impossible to know the end of the allocated memory of destination just with pointers since pointers only tell about the address. 

I used pointers to solve part 1 for extra credit. I tried to get used to the method about address and memory. 

I think I used about 50 hours implementing my codes.
